     * algorithms as a directed hierarchical graph.

     * <p>
     * For a transitive dependency, <code>LINKED</code> mode illustrates why Maven includes it in the build.

     * <p>
     * For a shared dependency (eg commons-logging), <code>LINKED</code> mode shows what other libraries depend on it.

     * on different versions of the same artifact.
